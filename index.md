# Greenguard Automated Plant Moisture Detection System 

GreenGuard is a home plant/garden monitoring system for all those green fingered people with a passion for their flora/fauna. The system will monitor your plants at home and provide the moisture content of the soil in which your plant is contained. Using ThingSpeak the user will get a live reading of the moisture content and when the moisture content drops below a certain value then the user will be alerted via email and twitter that the plant/plants need watering.
